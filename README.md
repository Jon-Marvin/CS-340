## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
## What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
All of my work included comments outlining all of the steps being taken in the code. The most important part to include is the why. Why a line of code is there is just as important as what it is. Using the comments helped me revisit certain
aspects of the code in later projects or the next day after signing off for the night.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
## What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approach problems in a tactical way. Rather than asking what the easiest way to do it is, I ask what's the most efficient way. My approach tends to require a lot of research, so I always have multiple tabs open to revisit anything I was referencing.
I plan to keep my approach the same moving forward. If everything is done the most effective way, anyone else viewing the code will have a better time understanding and updating it.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists figure out what makes the machine tick. They automate processes to make them easier for others, and they explore why something is happening a certain way. It is important because not everyone would be able to tap into 
languages to make things easier for themselves. Computer scientists can break down a problem and solve it in steps. Rather than having to dig through the data for their exact match, Grazioso Salvare is able to use the custom created dashboard 
to query animals that would fit their needs. They leave the technical work to the computer scientists and get what they need faster.
